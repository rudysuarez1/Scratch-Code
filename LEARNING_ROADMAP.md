## 🎯 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Basics (Start Here!)
**Goal:** Master fundamental programming concepts

#### Week 1-2: Algorithms - Language Choice
- Choose one language to start with (recommend Python for beginners)
- Complete all 10 problems in your chosen language
- Focus on:
  - Understanding syntax
  - Basic data structures (lists/arrays, strings)
  - Control flow (if/else, loops)
  - Functions

#### Week 3: Databases - SQL
- Complete all 15 SQL problems
- Focus on:
  - Creating tables
  - Basic CRUD operations
  - Joins
  - Aggregations

#### Week 4: Testing - Your Language
- Complete testing problems in the same language you chose for algorithms
- Focus on:
  - Writing test cases
  - Assertions
  - Test organization

### Phase 2: Intermediate
**Goal:** Expand to other languages and more complex problems

#### Week 5-6: Second Language
- Pick a second language (if you started with Python, try C++ or Java)
- Complete all 10 algorithm problems in the new language
- Compare approaches between languages

#### Week 7: Database Programming
- Complete database problems in Python or JavaScript
- Learn to connect code to databases
- Practice ORM concepts

#### Week 8: Advanced Testing
- Complete testing problems in your second language
- Learn about test fixtures, parametrization, mocking

### Phase 3: Advanced
**Goal:** Master all three languages and tackle complex scenarios

#### Week 9-10: Third Language
- Complete algorithm problems in the remaining language
- Focus on language-specific features and optimizations

#### Week 11: Full Stack Database
- Complete all database programming problems
- Build a small project connecting frontend, backend, and database

#### Week 12: Comprehensive Testing
- Complete all testing problems
- Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests for your previous solutions

## 📝 Problem-Solving Strategy

### For Each Problem:
1. **Read carefully** - Understand what the problem is asking
2. **Plan** - Think about the approach before coding
3. **Implement** - Write the solution
4. **Test** - Run your code with the examples provided
5. **Refactor** - Improve your code if possible
6. **Document** - Add comments explaining your approach

### Tips:
- Start with the easiest problems first
- Don't skip problems - each builds on previous concepts
- If stuck, take a break and come back with fresh eyes
- Try solving problems in multiple ways
- Compare your solutions with others (after solving yourself)

## 🚀 Next Steps After Completing Basics

Once you've completed all basic problems:

1. **Create Intermediate Problems**
   - Design your own problems in each category
   - Focus on real-world scenarios
   - Increase complexity gradually

2. **Build Projects**
   - Combine algorithms, databases, and testing
   - Create small applications
   - Practice version control

3. **Explore Advanced Topics**
   - Data structures (trees, graphs, hash tables)
   - Design patterns
   - Performance optimization
   - System design

## 🎓 Resources

### Learning Materials:
- **Algorithms**: "Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS), LeetCode
- **Databases**: SQL documentation, database tutorials
- **Testing**: Testing framework documentation, TDD books

### Practice Platforms:
- LeetCode (algorithms)
- HackerRank (algorithms)
- SQLZoo (SQL practice)
- Exercism (language-specific practice)

## 💡 Remember

- **Consistency is key** - Practice daily, even if just one problem
- **Quality over quantity** - Understand solutions, don't just copy
- **Ask questions** - Use comments in code to document your learning
- **Have fun** - Programming should be enjoyable!

Good luck on your coding journey! 🚀
