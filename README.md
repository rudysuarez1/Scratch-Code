# Code Practice Repository

This repository is for practicing and experimenting with various coding concepts, algorithms, database schemas, and testing different approaches.

## Directory Structure

```
├── databases/          # Database schema designs and SQL experiments
├── algorithms/         # Algorithm implementations and optimizations
├── testing/           # Code testing experiments and examples
├── experiments/       # General coding experiments and prototypes
└── Scratch-Code/      # Quick scratch work and temporary files
```

## Usage

### Databases
Use the `databases/` folder to:
- Design and test database schemas
- Experiment with different database patterns
- Practice SQL queries and optimizations
- Test migrations and schema changes

### Algorithms
Use the `algorithms/` folder to:
- Implement algorithms from scratch
- Optimize existing algorithms
- Compare different algorithmic approaches
- Practice data structures

### Testing
Use the `testing/` folder to:
- Experiment with different testing frameworks
- Practice test-driven development
- Create test examples and patterns
- Try different testing strategies

### Experiments
Use the `experiments/` folder for:
- Prototyping new ideas
- Trying out new libraries or frameworks
- Quick proof-of-concepts
- Any other coding experiments

## Getting Started

Feel free to create subdirectories within each category to organize your work. For example:
- `algorithms/sorting/`
- `algorithms/graph/`
- `databases/users/`
- `testing/unit-tests/`

Happy coding! 🚀
